# Deep-Natural-Language-Processing-of-Polyglot-File-Events-using-Quantum-Nerual-Network-Algorithms
A natual language processing, deep learning, and neural network model implementation with quantum algorithms for detecting and analyzing polyglot malware events from Crowdstrike and Microsoft Endpoint Security data.

The purpose of this project was to be able to engineer and successfully implement an innovative approach towards malware detection of acute polyglot files that go undetected by translating the data collected from a highly heterogeneous mix into a single representation so that security management tools can request or automatically ingest information that is formatted frequently through multiple, derived, heterogenous sources.  Creating a translator pulling out the most common, important, and diverse elements of security device telemetry data to support an abstract layer of data. This layer can be utilized for the generation of platform-independent outbound interfaces for reporting and alerting the security management system as well as an inbound interface for both response activities and configurations. Python and Cython will be the development languages chosen for implementing the deep neural network model design which will utilize quantum computing algorithms thanks to the available quantum libraries for Python. The cloud environment of choice for this research will be Microsoft Azure for deployment of the solution which also includes the use of the Microsoft Azure Quantum platform for further development implementations with internal resources such as Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based quantum processors that run quantum simulations.
